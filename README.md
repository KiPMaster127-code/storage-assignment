# storage-assignment

It was a fun assignment to work with. I found this exercise interesting in how simply the information can locally be stored and can be retrieved by using plain browser. Learning DOM was more challenging for me, when reading it through MDN is sounds simple and that it works well when writing Javascript code. After couple of days playing around with my code and to get it to work I realized that all it takes is a little bit of patience and the code will work after manipulating it with DOM.
